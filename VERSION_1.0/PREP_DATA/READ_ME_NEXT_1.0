 ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= =========08/16/93: Bug report: An error has been discovered in global surface salinity
     datasets distributed prior to 3/10/93.
          Bug description: Errors exist in a global surface salinity dataset
     used in-house by some GFDL modelers.  A shift in the seasonal cycle was
     created during the process of interpolating in time, so that this dataset
     did not match the seasonal salinities in the original Levitus, 1982 atlas.
     Since this dataset was used to derive the salinity fields supplied as part
     of the MOM Dataset, some MOM users may be affected (those who requested
     and received this dataset from us on boundary condition data tapes for
     use with the code found in the PREP_DATA directory).
       More specifically, the error involves the file "levitus.data" which is
     a "tar" file containing monthly salinities of the form... jan.salt.lev,
     feb.salt.lev, etc. The error is that the month prefixes "jan", "feb", etc.
     are incorrect in the sense that the data actually corresponds to 3 months
     earlier! The temperature files are correct.
       All copies distributed prior to 3/10/93 contain this error (a total of
     29 requests for the MOM dataset have been fulfilled).
          Bug Impact:  Just how much of an impact this error would have on
     model results depends on how the data is being used.  For example, if you
     are looking at deep convection in the North Atlantic and are restoring
     surface salinities toward seasonally varying "observed" values, the
     erroneous shift of seasons with regard to salinity would be quite
     important.  However, if you created annual mean salinity values from the
     files, no error would exist in the annual mean.
          Bug fix:  Short-term ... Those users who have received data tapes
     with this error should simply make the appropriate fixes locally, rather
     than requesting a new data tape.  Do the following...

     1st: extract the monthly salinity fields with:

     tar xvf levitus.data *.salt.mom

     2nd: rename the files:

     mv sep.salt.lev tempsep
     mv oct.salt.lev tempoct
     mv nov.salt.lev tempnov
     mv dec.salt.lev sep.salt.lev
     mv jan.salt.lev oct.salt.lev
     mv feb.salt.lev nov.salt.lev
     mv mar.salt.lev dec.salt.lev
     mv apr.salt.lev jan.salt.lev
     mv may.salt.lev feb.salt.lev
     mv jun.salt.lev mar.salt.lev
     mv jul.salt.lev apr.salt.lev
     mv aug.salt.lev may.salt.lev
     mv tempsep jun.salt.lev
     mv tempoct jul.salt.lev
     mv tempnov aug.salt.lev

       The month counter on the salinity units should also be changed to
     be consistent with the filename changes. In file "import.F" on units
     50 through 62, after the salinity data has been read in with:

     read (...,9200) month, ...

     change  "month" to be consistent with its filename by:

     month = mod(month+8,12) + 1

     before writing the data out.

     Long term ...  Future tapes will have the salinity data in the proper
     monthy files.
