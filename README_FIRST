MOM 1, originally released in December 1990, is no longer 
fully supported, nor is the Cox (1984) code. 
Similarly, earlier GFDL Ocean Group Technical Reports have 
been superceded by the MOM 2 Documentation: Users Guide and 
Reference Manual (GFDL Ocean Group Technical Report No. 3) -
over 260 pages of information that you can download from our
MOM 2 ftp site. 

Please note that with the release of MOM 2, we consider 
MOM 1 to be "frozen" at version 1.1. In other words, there 
are no plans to add new options to the MOM 1 code, nor for 
continued support of MOM 1.  However, if any significant 
errors are discovered in the MOM 1 model code, we will 
e-mail suggested bug fixes to registered users.
