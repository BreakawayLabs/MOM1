 ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= =========
08/16/93: Release date for GFDL MOM 1.1 is August 16, 1993
     Version 1.1 can be considered an incremental upgrade of the GFDL MOM
     code of 5 December 1990 (version 1.0).  Version 1.1 was created by
     taking version 1.0 and applying the bug fixes listed in "MOM_NEWS_1.0".
     The reported bugs have been corrected, but no new code options have
     been included.  With the release of the GFDL MOM version 1.1 code,
     version 1.0 should be considered "frozen".  In other words, future
     updates will refer to version 1.1.  However, since version 1.1 is
     essentially version 1.0 with bug fixes applied, one should easily be
     able to translate messages about version 1.1 to version 1.0 code.
