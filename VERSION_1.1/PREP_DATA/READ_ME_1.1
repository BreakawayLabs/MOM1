(i) General Overview:

The following files are intended for use at GFDL where they access data
archived on a CRAY YMP. The fortran is standard fortran 77 (except for
namelist) but the run decks are cray specific.
The archived climatological datasets can be exported to other CRAYs.
(written with fortran unformatted  sequential i/o. See "export.data")
These exported datasets may be useable on other computers if the
unformatted data can be read.

(iii)  Preparing data for MOM:

Once a specific MOM grid configuration has been set up, the
climatological data base can be interpolated onto MOM's grid. To
actually get the data into MOM requires additional code which is not
in MOM (ie: reading the data from within MOM)

1)  set up MOM for the desired resolution & configuration
    ie: set imt,jmt,km, etc      in param.h
        set stlon, stlat         in blkdta.F
        set xmax,xmin,xwid,idir  in blkdta.F
        set ymax,ymin,ywid,jdir  in blkdta.F
        run depths.f             to set the vertical levels


2)  set the following path names in the run decks:

 set modelpath   = path to your directory of MOM *.[Ffh] routines
 set preppath    = path to the directory of these data preparatory
                   routines
 set graphpath   = path to graphics package (only at GFDL)
 set datainpath  = path to  Levitus, Hellerman, & Oort climatologies
                   (which is /archive/o/rcp/climatology at GFDL)
 set dataoutpath = path to the directory where the interpolated
                   climatologies for MOM should go.
 set printoutpath= path to the directory where the fortran output
                   should go

(Note:  make sure these directories exist before running the programs.
and  set plots to yes only at GFDL)


3) run the sequence: topo.run, sbc.run,  & ic.run

$dataoutpath/mom.ic.clim        tar version of *temp.mom  and *salt.mom
                                where the "*" represents months.  "ann"
                                represents the annual. these are
                                direct access files in slab form
                                ie: t(imt,km) & s(imt,km) from j=1,jmt
$dataoutpath/mom.surf.clim      tar version of sst.mom  & sss.mom
                                which are direct access monthly sea surf
                                temp & salt.  ie: t(imt,jmt) &
                                s(imt,jmt) for n=1,13 (13 is annual)
$printoutpath/ic.t.*.plot       postscript graphics files (only at GFDL)
                                where * expands to indicate the month.
                                and t indicates temperature. s is for
                                salinity

(v)    The climatological database:

      These input climatologies are only intended for use with the
      above programs. The grids have been modified to include two
      extra points for the cyclic condition at Greenwich.

(vi)   Getting the climatological database

To get copies of this database for MOM, send us 2 half inch 6250bpi
blank tapes: DATA1 & DATA2. We will run "export.data".
Look at that run deck to see what you'll get.

(vii) Warnings:

It is left to the user of these programs to verify that the results
are correct (ie: don't blindly use these programs as black boxes ).
In particular, the levitus data has been extrapolated into land.
Those land values may not be reasonable in all cases: Particularly
around anarctica.
Be on the lookout for strange things happening near coastal areas.
If this is important, then some strategy should be used to rectify the
questionable points.

One strategy might be: After the interpolation to MOM's grid, search
all land mass perimeters (ocean points) and test if the values of T & S
are within reasonable proximity of a certain value. That value (for
example) might be the average of the surrounding ocean points (which are
not perimeter ocean points).
